- Select fields from other objects - you cannot do that easily
  - You could select myObject with join and where otherObject.field = something. But you would
    still have to query again (promise) otherObject from myObject.
- Where parameter should take care of strings. Eg. where' => ['field', 'op', 'value']
  - Not really - as you should never directly write the parameter. It should be '?' and parameters should be set.
